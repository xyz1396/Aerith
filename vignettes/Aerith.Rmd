# Abstract

Aerith is an R package for the simulation and visualization of isotopic envelopes in stable isotope 
probing (SIP) mass spectrometry data. It enables users to model and compare simulated and experimental 
isotopic patterns of peptides and metabolites with customizable chemical formulas and atom% enrichment. 
Aerith employs efficient algorithms—including sequential convolution for peptide fragments, 
Monte Carlo simulation for fine isotopic structures, and FFT-based methods for metabolites—to accurately 
generate isotopic distributions. Implemented in C++ for high performance, Aerith supports robust scoring 
functions for peptide-spectrum match evaluation and provides interactive visualization tools. Case studies 
in vignettes demonstrate its application to compounds such as glucose, penicillin, and microbial peptides, highlighting 
its utility for precise annotation and manual validation in proteomic and metabolomic SIP analyses.

# Introduction

Aerith is an R package designed for the simulation and analysis of theoretical isotopic peaks, 
fine structures, and spectral envelopes for user-defined chemical formulas or peptide sequences 
in metabolomics and proteomics. Unlike existing tools, Aerith supports flexible specification of
isotopic abundances for stable isotope probing (SIP) experiments, allowing users to model compounds
with any degree of isotopic enrichment. The package enables visualization and manual validation of 
both unlabeled and SIP-labeled peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs), facilitating interpretation of
complex mass spectrometry data. Aerith addresses limitations of previous software by providing
a unified framework for simulating isotopic distributions in both metabolomic and proteomic SIP 
workflows, supporting user-defined molecular structures and isotopic labeling patterns. 
Aerith accepts spectral data files in multiple formats, including Raxport-processed FT2, mzML, 
and MGF files, as well as pepXML and PIN files (Percolator outputs), and TSV files from the Sipros 
search engine for peptide amino acid sequences or PSM input. Integration with the mzR package from 
Bioconductor allows direct parsing of mzML and MGF files, while MSnbase enables parsing of pepXML files.
