## Working with FT1 and FT2 Files

FT1 and FT2 files represent Thermo Fisher's optimized format for MS1 and MS2 data, respectively. These formats offer several advantages including faster read times and smaller file sizes compared to mzML.

### Reading MS1 and MS2 Scan Data

The following example demonstrates different approaches to reading FT1 (MS1) data. Each function serves a specific purpose depending on your analysis needs:

```{r ft1-reading}
demo_file <- system.file("extdata", "demo.FT1", package = "Aerith")

# Read all MS1 scans into memory
# This approach is memory-intensive but provides fastest access for subsequent operations
all_scans <- readAllScanMS1(demo_file)

# Read a specific range of scans (scan numbers 1527-1550)
# Recommended when you know the specific scans of interest
scan_range <- readScansMS1(demo_file, 1527, 1550)

# Read a single scan by scan number
# Most memory-efficient for analyzing individual scans
single_scan <- readOneScanMS1(demo_file, 1555)

# Extract real scan data from the list structure
# Converts internal format to user-friendly data structure
processed_scan <- getRealScanFromList(all_scans[[88]])
plot(processed_scan)
```

**Parameter Selection Guidelines:**
- Use `readAllScanMS1()` when analyzing the entire dataset or when memory is not a constraint
- Use `readScansMS1()` with specific scan ranges for targeted analysis
- Use `readOneScanMS1()` for individual scan inspection or when building custom workflows

The plot generated shows the mass spectrum with m/z values on the x-axis and intensity on the y-axis. This visualization is crucial for quality assessment and identifying potential issues with the data.

Now let's examine MS2 data from FT2 files:

```{r ft2-reading}
demo_file <- system.file("extdata", "demo.FT2", package = "Aerith")

# Read all MS2 scans
all_ms2_scans <- readAllScanMS2(demo_file)

# Read specific scan range for MS2 data
ms2_range <- readScansMS2(demo_file, 1399, 1500)

# Read individual MS2 scan
single_ms2_scan <- readOneScanMS2(demo_file, 1371)

# Process and visualize MS2 spectrum
processed_ms2_scan <- getRealScanFromList(all_ms2_scans[[128]])
plot(processed_ms2_scan)
```

**MS2 Data Interpretation:**
The MS2 spectrum shows fragment ions resulting from peptide fragmentation. Peak patterns in MS2 spectra are essential for peptide identification and are particularly important in SIP proteomics where isotope incorporation affects fragmentation patterns.

### Creating Subset Files for Testing and Development

Creating smaller subset files is invaluable for testing workflows, debugging, and sharing data samples. This approach allows you to work with manageable datasets while preserving the original file structure.

**Creating MS1 Subset Files:**

```{r ft1-writing}
demo_file <- system.file("extdata", "demo.FT1", package = "Aerith")

# Read file header information (essential for maintaining file integrity)
header <- readFTheader(demo_file)

# Read all scans from the original file
ft1_data <- readAllScanMS1(demo_file)

# Create output directory
output_dir <- tempdir()

# Write subset containing first 10 scans
# This preserves file format while reducing file size significantly
writeAllScanMS1(header, ft1_data[1:10], file.path(output_dir, "demo10.FT1"))

# Verify file creation
subset_files <- list.files(output_dir, pattern = "demo10.FT1", full.names = TRUE)
print(paste("Created subset file:", subset_files))
```

**Key Advantages of This Approach:**
- Maintains original file format and structure
- Preserves metadata and header information
- Creates files suitable for method development and testing
- Reduces computational requirements for iterative analysis

**Creating MS2 Subset Files:**

```{r ft2-writing}
demo_file <- system.file("extdata", "demo.FT2", package = "Aerith")

# Read header and scan data
header <- readFTheader(demo_file)
ft2_data <- readAllScanMS2(demo_file)

# Create subset with first 10 MS2 scans
output_dir <- tempdir()
writeAllScanMS2(header, ft2_data[1:10], file.path(output_dir, "demo10.FT2"))

# Confirm successful file creation
subset_files <- list.files(output_dir, pattern = "demo10.FT2", full.names = TRUE)
print(paste("Created MS2 subset file:", subset_files))
```

**Best Practices for Subset Creation:**
- Always include representative scans from different retention time ranges
- Consider including both high and low intensity scans
- Document the selection criteria for reproducibility
- Verify that the subset maintains the essential characteristics of the original dataset

## Working with mzML Files

mzML (mass spectrometry Markup Language) is an open standard format that provides excellent cross-platform compatibility. Aerith's mzML support leverages the power of specialized libraries while providing a consistent interface.

**Reading mzML Data:**

```{r mzml-reading}
# mzML support requires the mzR package

demo_file <- system.file("extdata", "demo.mzML", package = "Aerith")

# Read MS1 data from mzML file
# mzML files can contain both MS1 and MS2 data in a single file
mzml_ms1_data <- readMzmlMS1(demo_file)

# Extract and visualize a specific MS1 scan
ms1_spectrum <- getRealScan(99, mzml_ms1_data)
plot(ms1_spectrum)

# Read MS2 data from the same mzML file
mzml_ms2_data <- readMzmlMS2(demo_file)

# Extract and visualize a specific MS2 scan
